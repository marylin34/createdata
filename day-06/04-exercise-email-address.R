# Validating the form of an email address is a common task. Let's create a package which will do this and other
# functions associated with email addresses.

# A valid email address has the form name@domain where the name can consist of
#
# - uppercase and lowercase Latin letters;
# - digits 0 to 9;
# - a selection of special characters; and
# - one or more periods, provided that it is not the first or last character
#
# and the domain is a valid domain name.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# * STAGE 0
#
# Set up the infrastructure for a new package.

# * STAGE 1
#
# Implement these functions:
# 
# FUNCTION: email_validate() - check for valid email address.
#
# FUNCTION: email_name() - extract the name from the email address.
#
# FUNCTION: email_domain() - extract the domain from the email address.

# * STAGE 2
#
# Create documentation for these functions.

# * STAGE 3
#
# Create unit tests for these functions.

# * STAGE 4
#
# Create a suitable data set to include with the package.
#
# Here's one option: a set of email addresses, labelled according to whether or not they are valid.

# * STAGE 5
#
# Create a suitable README.md file.
# Populate the DESCRIPTION file.

# * STAGE 6
#
# Test the package. Resolve any issues.

# * STAGE 7
#
# Publish the package on GitHub.
